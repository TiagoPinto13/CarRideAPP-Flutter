## Business Modelling

### Product Vision

Given the expenses and environmental effects associated with private transportation, we've opted to set up a sustainable transportation network at FEUP with a Carpooling System app. This platform encourages students to share rides, cutting down on traffic, carbon emissions, and transportation costs, while also promoting social equality.

### Features and Assumptions
#### Main Features:
* **User Registration:** Students will create profiles containing their personal information and vehicles they may use when giving rides
* **Scheduling trips:** Users can schedule trips, ensuring timely and efficient transportation arrangements for their commute
* **Communication Tools:** Built-in messaging and notification systems will enable users to coordinate logistics and communicate with their carpooling group
* **Sustainability Metrics:** Users will have access to metrics tracking their environmental impact, including carbon emissions saved and kilometers traveled via shared rides
* **Rating System:** Users will have the possibility to rate drivers, ensuring safety and accountability for all passengers


#### Extra Features:
* **Cost Sharing:** The app will provide information about transportation costs, such as fuel expenses, ensuring fair and equitable sharing among participants
* **Language and View options:** The app will offer language options (PT/EN and others), Light and Dark modes, and a simple, efficient design, ensuring ease of use for all users, regardless of technological proficiency
* **Disability Compatibility:** The app will offer the possibility to see which users' cars meet the requirements to travel with a disabled person.


### Elevator Pitch

Imagine a scenario where the FEUP students can share rides in a simple and efficient way, reduce traffic congestion, cut carbon emissions and save money. With the Carpooling App, this vision becomes a reality.  We encourage a culture of colaboration and sustainability on campus, embracing the principles of Circular Economy and promoting social equity. This is not only a way to innovate in trasportation, but to mold a more connected and environmentally conscious society. Join in this journey to create a happier and greener future for FEUP!

## Requirements

### Domain model

   Users can either be Unregistered or Registered. Unregistered users can become Registered Users through register. Registered Users can interact with other
Registered Users through messages, that contain a specific content. These Users can also rate other users, that they have previously shared a ride with. A Registered User can also create a ride, or join an existing ride.
  In each ride that the User participates, he can see the sustainability metrics of that ride.

## Architecture and Design
The architecture of a software system encompasses the set of key decisions about its overall organization. 

A well written architecture document is brief but reduces the amount of time it takes new programmers to a project to understand the code to feel able to make modifications and enhancements.

To document the architecture requires describing the decomposition of the system in their parts (high-level components) and the key behaviors and collaborations between them. 

In this section you should start by briefly describing the overall components of the project and their interrelations. You should also describe how you solved typical problems you may have encountered, pointing to well-known architectural and design patterns, if applicable.

### Logical architecture
The purpose of this subsection is to document the high-level logical structure of the code (Logical View), using a UML diagram with logical packages, without the worry of allocating to components, processes or machines.

It can be beneficial to present the system in a horizontal decomposition, defining layers and implementation concepts, such as the user interface, business logic and concepts.

  
The logical view of the Carpooling App encompasses the User Interface, which allows users to interact with the various features of the application. These features are implemented within the app's logic, where the functionality is developed and executed.

For features requiring location input from users, the app utilizes Google Maps APIs. Specifically, the Places API is employed to convert latitude and longitude coordinates into corresponding location names and vice versa. Additionally, it provides autocomplete functionality for location names. The Directions API is utilized to calculate routes between two points, along with estimating travel time and distance based on default configurations.

Firebase serves as the online database for the app, where data is both accessed and stored. Within Firebase, the Authentication API is utilized for user authentication, while the Cloud Firestore API is employed to store persistent data.

To accurately describe the app's structure and functionality, various tools such as UML diagrams, Figma, and others may be used to create a comprehensive schema. These tools help in visually representing the architecture and flow of the Carpooling App.

### Physical architecture
The goal of this subsection is to document the high-level physical structure of the software system (machines, connections, software components installed, and their dependencies) using UML deployment diagrams (Deployment View) or component diagrams (Implementation View), separate or integrated, showing the physical structure of the system.

It should describe also the technologies considered and justify the selections made. Examples of technologies relevant for ESOF are, for example, frameworks for mobile applications (such as Flutter).

 The diagram depicts a deployment view of a carpooling system, where a user interacts with the UniRideShare App on their smartphone. 
The App provides a user interface for creating and listing ride offers, connecting to logical services for processing. 
Ride offers are stored in an active rides database. Additionally, the system utilizes localization functionalities, accessing a localization API for obtaining location data.

### Vertical prototype 

We have started implementing the login page to assure that we can fully utilize all techonologies, that is, flutter and Firebase. Login will require an email and password, which need to be verified. There'll also be an option to recover your password if forgotten.

Example:
 <p align="center" justify="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2023-24/2LEIC02T4/blob/main/docs/login.png"/>
</p>

The first version of the Search Page was also created in Flutter. On this page, users can search for the trip that best suits their needs, based on their desired starting point, destination, date, and the number of passengers for the trip. The result is presented in the following image.

Search Page:

</p>


To ensure consistency on future development, we started to design the main components of our screens, namely buttons, including dark mode and light mode colors, an app bar and a navigation bar. We have also defined and implemented in flutter the collor pallette that is to be utilized on both app themes and the different text styles.
