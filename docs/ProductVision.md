### Vision:
Our vision is to create a more sustainable transportation ecosystem within FEUP by implementing a Carpooling System mobile application. This application will facilitate the formation of carpooling groups among students, allowing them to optimize their travel to and from the university while reducing the number of individual vehicles on the road. By fostering a culture of shared transportation, we aim to minimize fossil fuel consumption, decrease carbon emissions, and alleviate the financial burden associated with private car ownership. Additionally, our vision extends beyond environmental concerns; we seek to promote social equity by providing affordable transportation options to those who may not have access to private vehicles.
